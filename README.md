# About
This repository contains a pipeline in a Jupyter notebook, which I created while competing in the Wharton Global High School Competition. 
This pipeline is able to load CSV files, cleanup the data and pull further up-to-date data from the Yahoo Finance API.
This project has been put together extremely quickly and is mere work in progress.
# Dependencies
main dependencies required include: 
1. yfinance (pip install yfinance)
2. pandas (conda/pip install pandas)
3. openpyxl (conda/pip install openpyxl)
4. anyother dependencies which may arise in the future...
